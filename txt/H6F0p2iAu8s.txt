 Who taught you to play? Well, that taught myself really. I picked up a few bits of the caramel. Not the carnival. Oh yeah, the same cowboy's that come through and teach me all sorts of funny cards. And he passed during the show, in the Kansas, here at the Cottas. Yeah, these cards I went in from a cowboy named Wigglefoot. You were in a carnival. You were so completely full of shit. I had lessons as a kid, you know normal lessons. I write too, I'm not sure there's a way to learn that. Too hard. Excuse me? You tried too hard. Too right. Really? Yeah, if you're asking. I wasn't. The sun sets in seagulls, the smell of butter cups, your signs are like a normal painting at the dentist's office. You're kind of an asshole, Bob. Yeah, I guess. Play this. See you next time. How many roads must the man want to go? Now before you call him a man, how many seas must the white does heal? The fall she sleeps in the sand, guessing how many times must the cannon balls play? Before there forever bad. The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind How many years must a mountain exist? The forest washed to the sea How many years can some people exist? The forest fell out to be free Yes and how many times can a man turn his hand Pretend that he just doesn't see The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind How many times must a man look up? Before he can see the sky How many years must one man have? Before he can hear people cry Isn't how many deaths will it take? Did he know that too many people have died? The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind This is the one I don't know The answer is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind
