Krashenaak: In this video, I will be talking about how you can develop some amazing drag applications with the help of landflow. Landflow is a low code tool for developers that make it easier to build powerful AI agents and workflow that can use API model or databases. In the video, we will be going step by step with respect to that. You can create a drag application without any code. You just need to provide the opening IKE. You don't have to do much and this entire thing will be acting as a chatbot. Along with all this, you can also write the code in Python. Langflow lets you create your own chatbot using Python, JavaScript and Astradebi. Langflow also provides the option of creating the data stack database. You can also use other embedding techniques from Huggin, Grok and whichever you want. So we are going to use the opening. I model again, it is up to you. What is the document all about? So document appears to be the application of print for attention mechanism in neural networks and all. So this is what we basically do while creating the rank. And finally it is going to the open AI, which is my final model. You can change your model based on your requirement. And then you get the chat output, right? Just imagine developing your application five minutes without writing any code with the help of Langflow. So yeah, this was it from my site. I'll see you on the next video. Have a great day.
