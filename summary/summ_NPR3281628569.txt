For years, the Chinese government has been detaining and imprisoning hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region of China. In 2021, NPR's China correspondent, Emily Fang, started following one family whose lives were torn apart by this crackdown. What she found became The Blackgate, a three-part series on NPR's Embedded podcast. In 1949, Chinese troops marched into Xinjiang and declared it part of the new communist China. In the 1930s and 40s, Uyghurs and other ethnic groups had resisted Chinese occupation. After communist China took control, the Kuchar family history of resistance became a political stain. Abdul Latif and Miryam Ahmet met in 1990 in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. Abdul Latif tried splitting his time between Turkey and China. But that brief window of openness in the 1990s quickly ended after September 11th, 2001. Uyghurs said they were passed over for state jobs and paid less than their Han Chinese counterparts. Uyghur factory workers died in a brawl with the Han. 156 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Xinjiang. Abdul Weli Ayyup is a Uyghur language rights activist and former political prisoner. He was arrested and interrogated as China geared up for the People's War on Terror. Abdul Weli and his family have been trapped in Xinjiang for nearly a year. China has built a vast network of detention camps for Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It's probably the largest internment of an ethnic or religious minority since the Holocaust. Next week, we will continue the story of Abdul Latif and the search for his family. Next week, we will continue the story of Abdul Latif Kuchar and the search for his missing family. The music you're hearing is a folk song called Nazugum by Uyghur musician Abdurrahim Haidt. The Blackgate is a collaboration with NPR's International Desk.
